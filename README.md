# Search-Algorithm-Vesualiser

search algorithm vesualizer made with pygame and python:
  Algorithms that should be in the program:
  1- beadth first search algortih
  2- Djikstra's search algortih
  3- A* search algorithm
  4- Greedy search algorithm
 
The program is 4 parts:
  first: a grid creator class to create and edit the grid
  second: a menu creator to create and edit menu actions for the program
  third: a search class that has the algorithms (only bread first search is finished so far)
  fourth: the main core class that runs the program
